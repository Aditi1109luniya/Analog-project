A 10KΩ load needs to be driven by an amplifier with 14000 gain power at 30 kHz with no phase reversal in its output. Design a suitable amplifier to meet the objectives. Find out its input and output impedances. Draw gain vs frequency response and find out its bandwidth. description for resume in key point

Technical Summary (For understanding)

1. Requirements:
Load: 10 kΩ
Power Gain: 14,000
Frequency: 30 kHz
No phase reversal
Determine: Input & Output Impedance, Bandwidth, Frequency Response



2. Design:
Use a multi-stage amplifier (e.g., two or three transistor stages or op-amps) to achieve the required gain.
Ensure each stage has a moderate gain (e.g., 50–100x) to prevent distortion or instability.
Choose capacitor values and transistor/op-amp biasing to maintain linear response up to 30 kHz.



3. No Phase Reversal:
Use non-inverting configurations (like non-inverting op-amp or common-collector stages).
Maintain proper feedback design to avoid inversion.



5. Impedance Calculations:
Input Impedance (Zin): High enough to avoid loading the signal source (typically > 100 kΩ for op-amp).
Output Impedance (Zout): Low enough (< 1 kΩ) to drive 10 kΩ load without signal drop.



5. Frequency Response & Bandwidth:
Plot gain vs. frequency using simulation (e.g., LTspice, Multisim, or MATLAB).
Bandwidth = frequency range where gain stays within -3 dB of maximum.
